### Explanation of the project
The aim of this project is to list the latest major updates to my projects, each time indicating the current version of the project, as well as the latest updates. ‚öôÔ∏è<br>
This project is in no way for commercial purposes at the moment, and I see no point in making it commercial since the only thing it does is display the latest update, as well as what's been updated. ü™ô<br><br>
**However, this project is subject to the Licenses indicated in the License file of this GitHub repository. It cannot be sold or used for commercial purposes without my consent. ‚öñÔ∏è**

### Technologies used
This is not a very, very large project, so it won't be using very advanced technologies. The technologies used for this project are listed below:

|                                                                    **Language**                                                                   |                                                                            **Usefulness to the project**                                                                           |

This list is subject to change at any time, but the project as I see it now only requires these 3 technologies. In the future, if I wish to improve the project considerably, I may add other technologies to push the code further.
