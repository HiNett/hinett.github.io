# Why does session.php is private ?
Hi ! ðŸ‘‹<br>
As long as the public version of the code is not shared, protected files will remain private. ðŸ”’<br>Once the public version of the code has been finalized, you'll have a set of files that will once again be accessible, without containing any private information.
<br>The `private_files.md` file lists all files that are currently private (.gitignore), so you can see which files are currently missing.<br>This file is located in the project tree.
